# Microprocessor-Trainer-Board_Embedded_system

The main purpose of this project is to implement a microprocessor trainer board using STM32F446RE micro-processor. STM32F446 is an Advanced RISC Machines(ARM) based microprocessor prepared by ST-Electronics mounted on the Nucleo-stm32f446re board. In this project,a goal was set to take advantage of all the peripherals and available customizable pins of the whole nucleo board. Compactness, smoothness and simplicity were the key factors for designing the whole project. STM32F series micro- processors offer a variety of operations such as signal processing ,serial communication, wireless communicating modules interfacing, display interfacing,pwm applications and many other things. This trainer board features almost all the common features stm32f series offers as well as customizable operations such as interfacing LCD- display,LED Matrix,7-segment display,bluetooth module,speaker,rgb,keypad,sonar-sensor, stepper motor, analog to digital and digital to analog converter.
